# Abstract Data Structured (ADT)

This project implements the main ADTs in the following programing languages: 
-   C
-   Java
-   Python
-   JS

## Getting Started

All the scripts that are showed here were developed using _VSCode_ (_C, Python and JS_) and _Eclipse_ (_Java_) in _Linux OS_. So, I recommend you to use a _Linux_ platform to avoid incompatibilities. This project has educational porpouses and everyone could use it as they need it.

### Prerequisites

-   To run the _C's_ script in a _Linux_ platform, you only need to compile them using ```gcc``` and then execute it. In a _Windows_ platform I recomend you to use _Codeblocks_ or a similar program like it.

-   To run the _Java's_ script in a _Linux_ or _Windows_ platform, you need to install ```Java 8``` in your machine and then install _Eclipse_ (or something similar you prefer). There you can execute then without problems.

-   To run the _Python's_ script in a _Linux_ or _Windows_ platform you need to install ```Python``` in your machine and execute them using your terminal.

-   To run the _JS's_ script in a _Linux_ or _Windows_ platform you need to install _Node_ using _npm_ or _yarn_ and execute them using your terminal.
